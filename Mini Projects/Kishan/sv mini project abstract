TITLE: DESIGN AND VERIFICATION OF EVEN PARITY BIT GENERATOR

ABSTRACT
This SystemVerilog project involves the design and verification of an Even Parity Bit Generator module, an essential component in data communication systems.
The module takes a 7-bit binary input and produces an additional parity bit to enforce even parity, a common error-checking technique. The significance of 
even parity lies in its ability to detect single-bit errors in transmitted data. As data integrity is crucial in many applications, especially in environments 
susceptible to noise and interference, the Even Parity Bit Generator project aims to contribute a reliable solution.To test the functionality of the Even Parity
Bit Generator, a testbench is created using systemverilog HDL. This testbench evaluates the module's performance by providing different 7-bit data inputs 
and verifying that the generated parity bit conforms to the expected even parity. Through systematic testing, the project not only aims to validate the 
proper implementation of the module but also to showcase the broader applicability of even parity as a fundamental error-checking mechanism in digital 
communication systems. This project serves as an educational and practical exploration of hardware design and verification principles using the SystemVerilog 
language.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES
1.	SystemVerilog Proficiency: Participants gain proficiency in SystemVerilog, a hardware description and verification language widely used in digital design 
  projects.
2.	Verification Practices: The project emphasizes robust verification practices, providing hands-on experience in creating systematic testbenches to validate 
  hardware functionality.
